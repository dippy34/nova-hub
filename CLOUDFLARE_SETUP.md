# Cloudflare Workers Setup Guide

This guide will help you migrate your Express.js API to Cloudflare Workers.

## Step 1: Create KV Namespaces

1. Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Workers & Pages** → **KV**
3. Create 4 KV namespaces:
   - `SUGGESTIONS_KV` - for storing suggestions and bug reports
   - `ANALYTICS_KV` - for storing analytics data
   - `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_KV` - for storing admin credentials
   - `TOKENS_KV` - for storing authentication tokens

4. Note down the **Namespace ID** for each namespace

## Step 2: Update wrangler.toml

1. Open `wrangler.toml`
2. Replace the placeholder IDs with your actual KV namespace IDs:
   ```toml
   [[kv_namespaces]]
   binding = "SUGGESTIONS_KV"
   id = "your-actual-suggestions-kv-id"
   preview_id = "your-actual-suggestions-kv-preview-id"
   ```

3. Do this for all 4 KV namespaces

## Step 3: Migrate Existing Data

Run the migration script to copy your existing JSON data to KV:

```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI if you haven't already
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Run the migration script
node scripts/migrate-to-kv.js
```

## Step 4: Deploy Workers Function

The Workers function is already set up at `functions/api/[[path]].js`. 

To deploy:

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare
wrangler deploy
```

Or if using Cloudflare Pages, the function will be automatically deployed when you push to your repository.

## Step 5: Update Cloudflare Pages Configuration

Pages allows **max 25 MiB per file**. Some non-semag games (Escape Road, Escape Road 2, Escape Road City) contain larger Unity `.wasm.unityweb` files, so they are excluded from the build output.

In your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:

1. Go to your project settings → **Builds & deployments**
2. Under **Build configuration**, set:
   - **Framework preset:** `None`
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory:** `dist`
   - **Root directory:** (leave empty)

The build script (`scripts/pages-build.js`) copies the site into `dist/` and omits the three oversized game folders. Escape Road City 2 and other non-semag games under 25 MiB per file are included. The excluded games (Escape Road, Escape Road 2, Escape Road City) will only be available when running locally or when served from another host (e.g. R2 + Worker).

## Step 6: Test the API

After deployment, test your API endpoints:

- `POST /api/submit-suggestion` - Should work without authentication
- `POST /api/admin/login` - Should authenticate and return a token
- `GET /api/admin/suggestions` - Should require authentication

## Important Notes

1. **Static Files**: Cloudflare Pages will automatically serve your static HTML/CSS/JS files. The Workers function only handles `/api/*` routes.

2. **File System**: Workers don't have access to the file system. All data must be stored in KV.

3. **Node.js Modules**: Workers use the Web API, not Node.js. The code has been converted to use:
   - Web Crypto API instead of Node's `crypto`
   - KV storage instead of `fs`
   - Fetch API (native in Workers)

4. **IP Address**: Workers automatically provide the client IP via `cf-connecting-ip` header, which is more reliable than Express.

5. **Token Expiration**: Tokens now expire after 24 hours. You may want to implement token refresh logic.

## Troubleshooting

- **KV not found**: Make sure you've created the KV namespaces and updated `wrangler.toml` with the correct IDs
- **Authentication fails**: Check that admin credentials were migrated to KV
- **CORS errors**: The Workers function includes CORS headers, but you may need to adjust them for your domain

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:
1. Your original `index.js` Express server is still in the repository
2. You can deploy it to a Node.js hosting service (Railway, Render, etc.)
3. Update your frontend API URLs to point to the new server
