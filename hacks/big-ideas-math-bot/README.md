# Big-Ideas-Math-Bot-2.0
This is a reworked version of BIM Bot, a cheat that gives you the answers to Big Ideas Math problems. This version erases the inconvenience of creating an entire extremely suspicious window and opening the console to get the answers.

# What we did:
First, we decoded and reverse engineered the original BIM BOT program.
Then, we cleaned it up by:
1. Completely removing the need for an entire window with a button to log the answers in the console
2. Displaying the answers in a dissmisble normal looking alert window. (If it is a graphing question, it creates a very minimilastic draggable window with a transparent background and small but visible black text displaying the points to plot on the graph.

# HOW TO USE

When dealing with a normal question (A/B/C/D , Number answers, etc) it simply creates a dissmisable alert window displaying the answers
When dealing with a graphinh question, it creates a very minimilastic draggable window with a transparent background and small but visible black text displaying the points to plot on the graph. (USE THE , KEY TO SHOW/HIDE IT and USE THE . KEY TO DELETE IT COMPLETELY)

1. Bookmarklet Code: Create a new bookmark, right click it, go into the URL textbox, and paste the code in. Name the bookmark whatever you want.
2. Developer Code: This is the code in regular form, meant for anyone who wants to see how it works, run it in inspect element, reverse engineer, etc.

# Policy

If you use this in any way other than it's intended use to cheat... I don't care, no credit needed. Do what you want with it, this is just the version I use and figured it would be helpful to anyone fed up with the annoying design of the old version.

NOTE - I HAVE NO RELATIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFICIAL BIG IDEAS MATH BOT

# Thanks!
